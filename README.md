Udacity Introduction of machine learning final project
======================================================
- poi_id.py: Using the select k best method. The machine learning algorithm is using AdaBoost
- poi_id_pca.py: Using pca to seek different number of components. The algorithm is logistic regression
- myTools.py: This includes some function to calculate the available data points in each feature. Also, it can set up the threshold to return the feature list.
- AddingFeature.py: This can duplicate, delete, and do other feature calculation. After that, it can name it to a new feature to save into the existed feature list and push all the data back into the Enron data dict.
- PCAApproach.py: Not using right now.
- tester.py: The original tester.py for testing the result
- /tools: The tools provided by Udacity for the final project
- /final_report: final_report.docx and final_report_rubric.docx
- my_classifer.pkl: The classifier for the best result
- my_dataset.pkl: The dataset for the best result
- my_feature_list.pkl: The feature list for the best result
